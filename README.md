# NetExt

Installation:

>Precompiled .so files are avalible and in place for most systems. However, if they for some case do not want to work, follow these steps:

1. Install `libcgal-dev` and `libglwf3-dev` (dependencies)
2. Make sure you have `make`, `cmake`, `sed` and `curl` installed (the installation scripst need them)
3. navigate to the main directory and run `sh install.sh`. This step will create a directory named "build". All the build files will be there, and after compilation, it will automatically copy the .so files to their places.
